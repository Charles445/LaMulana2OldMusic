You can get depot downloader here:
https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader

Click on "Releases", download the latest version zip, and extract it to a folder.
Find "DepotDownloader.exe" in that folder.
Copy the "get_old_depot.bat" file from this repository into the same folder as "DepotDownloader.exe".
Open the "get_old_depot.bat" file you just copied over with notepad
Follow the instructions inside the batch file
(replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with your steam credentials, run the batch file, enter your steam guard key, and wait)

Once the download is complete, find the file in the newly downloaded depot "sharedassets1.resource" (it should be roughly 554mb)
Rename it to "oldmusic.resource"
Copy the "oldmusic.resource" file to your steam LaMulana2_Data folder
Copy the "LaMulana2OldMusic.exe" file to your LaMulana2 folder (make sure it's the right version, ex. folder 1_8_8_2 = La Mulana 2 Version 1.8.8.2)
Run the exe and click Next a lot.
Done! Launch the game and enjoy.

If you wish to revert the mod, rename "sharedassets1.assets.bak0000" to "sharedassets1.assets", replacing the other one
